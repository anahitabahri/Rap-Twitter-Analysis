# Anahita's Final Project: An Analysis of Rappers Using Twitter and Lyrics Data
As mentioned in the [readme](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/README.md) on my github repo, this project was born from the [Million Song Project](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Million-Song-Project) I recently worked on. Why am I interested in this field? For starters, I'm a musician. After getting studying Music Business at Berklee College of Music, I ended up working at some awesome music industry companies, including Shazam and Universal Music Group. Why rap in particular? I love rap and hip-hop. In fact, I named my cat after Biggie Smalls.

### Getting the tweets: searchTwitter vs. filterStream?
I primarily used filterStream to get tweets for text analysis and visualization. I was able to get more tweets, while searchTwitter had a limitation on how many tweets I could get data on. I did, however, use userTimeline(), which is from the twitteR package. It was easier to get tweets from a particular user (rappers, in my case) using that vs. options in the streamR package. Unfortunately, though, I had a tough time getting accurate location data. When getting tweets in the US that mentioned key words related to Biggie and 2Pac, I received tweets outside the US, despite providing long/lat coordinates to create a border. I also received tweets unrelated to Biggie and 2Pac, despite providing information in the track parameter within filterStream. I'm unsure why this was the case, but you can feel free to explore this further in my [get_tweets.R](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/get_tweets.R) script.


### Mapping Tweets in US
This code can be looked into in detail in my [mapping_us_tweets.R](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/mapping_us_tweets.R) script. I also attempted to create a [shiny app](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/tree/master/shiny_map) using this map, but haven't been successful yet. I will update this file once I fix things. 
```{r, warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE, message=FALSE}
us_tweets.df3 <- read_csv('shiny_map/us_tweets.csv')
us_tweets.df3 <- data.frame(us_tweets.df3)

m <- leaflet(us_tweets.df3) %>% addTiles('http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', 
                                         attribution='Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a> &mdash; Map data &copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>') 
# m %>% setView(-100.044345, 41.314352, zoom = 4)
m %>% addCircles(~lon, ~lat, popup=us_tweets.df3$lon, weight = 3, radius=40, 
                 color="#ffa500", stroke = TRUE, fillOpacity = 0.8) 


# setView sets central location to NEBRASKA, so we can zoom into the US.
# However, since we have bad data (data outside the United states), this doesn't work.
```

When zoomed in, the map of the United States looks like the following:

#### 2Pac vs. Biggie Tweets
All code can be found in the folder [shiny_twitter_wc](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/tree/master/shiny_twitter_wc). This was not the best text data to create a meaningful visualization, which is why I looked into lyrics data.

#### 2Pac vs. Biggie Lyrics
All code can be found in the folder [shiny_lyrics_wc](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/tree/master/shiny_lyrics_wc). The shiny app is also live [here](https://anahita.shinyapps.io/shiny_lyrics_wc/). This tool solidifies my findings in the Million Song Project -- although 2Pac enjoys swearing to an extent, Biggie surpasses him in swearing in songs. 2Pac seems to sing about "Lord" quite a bit. I have lyrics data for songs and artists under the "Religious" genre -- it would be cool to explore rap vs. religious music. I would imagine that there would be very different frequent terms in the 2 genres.

#### Rappers influenced by 2Pac and/or Biggie
As I mentioned in the readme, I decided to bring in data for rappers who were either heavily influenced by the 2 rappers or considered associated acts. These rappers include 50 Cent, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, P. Diddy, and Snoop Dogg. The [exploring_rapper_data script](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/exploring_rapper_data.R) includes code that extracts the most common hashtags used by these rappers. The charts can be found in the [hashtag_charts folder](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/tree/master/hashtag_charts). Also, I created a [shiny app](https://anahita.shinyapps.io/shiny_rap_tweets_wc/) that displays word clouds for these rappers too. The code used for creating that shiny app can be found in the [shiny_rap_tweets_wc folder](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/tree/master/shiny_rap_tweets_wc).

#### Million Song Dataset
I also explored gganimate using the million song dataset. All the gifs can be found in the [msd_analysis](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/tree/master/msd_analysis) folder or in the [readme](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Rap-Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/README.md) file. These animated charts don't necessarily tell a very meaningful story. However, you can tell that, overall, artists in the rap genre have more variability than artists of the country genre. Also, the top rappers are hottter and more familiar than artists in the country genre. We also notice that we don't have much data for rap songs in 2010.

## Next Steps
Since the twitter tools failed to get me good and accurate data to explore (almost correct location data without tracking correct keywords, meaningless tweets about biggie and 2pac), I'd like to explore similar analysis focusing on just lyrics data that's not in a bag of words format.  
  
I'd like to go beyond the wordcloud and analyze and visualize text data with cluster dendrograms, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, random forests, among other things.
