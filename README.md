As a super fan of hip-hop and rap, I decided to embark on a study of tweets revolving around these genres, focusing on a few rappers. This project stems from my work with the [Million Song Dataset](https://github.com/anahitabahri/Million-Song-Project), for which the slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13tOvAZHGCCmxWPWQydHQgfHqdQbYAEYmDfxn_jmuroo/edit?usp=sharing). 

I wanted to focus on the rivalry between the late 2Pac and Biggie, but decided to bring in data for rappers who were either heavily influenced by the 2 rappers or considered associated acts. These rappers include 50 Cent, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, P. Diddy, and Snoop Dogg.
